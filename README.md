# Wiki Racer

Inspired by a Stanford challenge found [here](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2018/malik-wikiracer/), this project aims to create a bot, that when given two inputs of any relation, will find a connection between them through Wikipedia. Utilizing goroutines, web scraping, and simple parsing of JSON, this project was made to better my understanding of Go.
